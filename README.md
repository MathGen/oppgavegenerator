# Oppgavegenerator / MathGen

This branch is for testing calculations in the template editor, and trying to fix dependencies between them.

This project aims to make an e-learning site for mathematics, where teachers can publish
mathematical problem templates with random variables to be generated into solvable mathematical problems.
Problem templates can be sorted in organized sets with a progression determined by an ELO-like rating system.

The project combines Django, MathQuill, jQuery and SymPy to allow feature-rich mathematical input and calculation.

The main language for the project is Norwegian. Internationalization is a possibility in the future.
